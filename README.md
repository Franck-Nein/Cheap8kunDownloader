# Cheap8kunDownloader
Download media from 8kun.top threads

8Dwget.py uses wget to download the files(works better for me)

8DwgetNf.py uses wget to download the files but doenst need the urls.txt(slower and cant stop it)

8Durllib.py uses urllib to download the files(slower than wget but only uses python)

I will merge the if I learn how to do options in python
